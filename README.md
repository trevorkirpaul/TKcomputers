### ecommerce app

This app is portfolio project for a fictional company that sells custom build computers, software and parts. I plan on implementing a lot of tiny features that will make this app robust and hopefully feel like a real store.

Ideas:
1. Shopping Cart
2. Email confirmations post purchase
3. Order Tracking/history
4. Review System
5. User Profiles
6. Custom orders
7. Support Tickets
8. Customer views / admin views
9. Chat bot to assist customers
10. Using Stripe to process fake purchases

Tech Stack: React, Redux, MongoDB, Express/Node

### Goals:

My goals for this portfolio project are to showcase the improvements made from bartr. I don't plan on cutting any corners so errors will all be processed correctly and legitimate form validation will be used.

My backend API server which will handle the parts/software database as well as user profiles is almost complete. It's also noticably better organized than bartr.

I will be spending time at first creating a tool to easily add items to the database and it will end up being an admin only tool in production. 

### Concerns:

I know that SPA have terrible authetication. I want to make sure non-admin users can't access the upload API so this will be a huge focus. I'm not sure exactly how I will do this atm.

Other than that, I'm fairly confident I can complete everything on my idea list. I will have to look up how to make a chatbot and research Stripe.

In the end I want this to feel like it's an actual ecommerce site with every modern day option available. Things like coupon codes, email confirmations and a website with a robust look/feel will be important. I'm going to set my deadline at 2 weeks, just like with the bartr app. I won't be spending a lot of time figuring out styling or http methods so I'm sure I'll complete it in time. This app will be much more complicated, however, so anything can happen.
